# Test Application Development

> A projects by Budi Setiawan showcasing software tools for testing and validation using .NET C#, WPF, WinForm, NI TestStand, LabView, and Python.

## 🧾 Overview

This project,  **“Test Application Development”**, is part of a broader portfolio of automation, embedded systems, full-stack web, and test tools by Budi Setiawan. ([projectsbdsetiawan.com](https://projectsbdsetiawan.com/))
The purpose of the application is to provide a structured, reliable environment for creating, executing and managing tests—whether functional tests, automated integration tests, or system-level validation tests.

## 🔧 Key Features

Based on the portfolio context, the application likely includes (or should include) the following features:

* A test‐case management interface: create, edit, delete test cases, group them into test suites.
* Execution engine: ability to run tests (manually or automatically), track results (pass/fail), capture logs, screenshots or data.
* Reporting: summarise test results, generate exportable reports (e.g., PDF, HTML), track trend over time.
* Integration with other tools/technologies: given the portfolio mentions automation, PLC, LabVIEW, TestStand, full-stack web, the application may integrate with e.g. hardware or instrumentation, or orchestrate test sequences in embedded/industrial context.
* Web or desktop UI: a user-friendly interface for testers and engineers.
* Backend database/storage: to store test cases, results, logs, configuration.
* Possibly role/permission management: to assign testers, reviewers, administrators.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

While the portfolio page doesn’t provide full details of this particular project, given the author’s expertise listed as: “AI • Machine Learning • Computer Vision • Full-Stack Web • Automation • PLC • TestStand • LabVIEW” ([projectsbdsetiawan.com](https://projectsbdsetiawan.com/))
We can assume the stack may include:

* Frontend: WPF, WindForm, JavaScript (and related frameworks, e.g., React, Angular, Vue), HTML, CSS.
* Backend: .NET / C#, or other full-stack web technologies (since other portfolio items mention ASP.NET [C#] Projects).
* Data storage: SQL-based database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL) or NoSQL depending on architecture.
* Integration layer: possibly using hardware interfaces (PLC, test instrumentation), maybe via LabVIEW or TestStand.
* Deployment/hosting: Possibly using GitHub Pages (for portfolio), but for this application maybe self-hosted or on cloud.

## 🎯 Why It Matters / Use Cases

* Streamlines testing workflows: Centralising test case management helps reduce duplication and manual effort.
* Improves traceability: You can link test cases to requirements, log results, produce audit-ready reports.
* Supports automation: Enables automated test runs, integration with instrumentation or embedded systems (which aligns with the author’s automation/PLC background).
* Facilitates collaboration: With a web interface, multiple testers/engineers can collaborate, track progress, and share results.
* Enhances quality assurance: By having structured reports and tracking trends, the project supports continuous improvement.

## 🧪 Ideal Audience

* QA Engineers / Test Engineers working in software, embedded or hardware domains.
* Developers who need to integrate test operations into CI/CD pipelines.
* Automation engineers working with instrumentation, PLCs, hardware validation.
* Project managers or test leads looking for visibility into test coverage, results, and trends.
